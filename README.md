# Kickstarting with Excel
## Project Overview

The Client had a play on Kickstarter that came close to its fundraising goals, but ultimately failed; now they now wants to understand how its launch date and funding goals will affect their new campaign.

### Purpose

Using Excel this project will visualize Kickstarter campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

Two instruments were created to better uncover these data trends. The first is a chart of successful, failed and canceled kickstarter vs their respective launch months. The second groups fundraising goals into $5000 increments and compares them to their respective success rates.
